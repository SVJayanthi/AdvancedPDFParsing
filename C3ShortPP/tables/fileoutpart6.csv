Spruce Point Question  ,“C3 just announced the launch of a Generative AI Product that will be available in March that will integrate Open AI and advanced models such as ChatGPT. Can you distill what this means and why all the excitement around this?”  
Answer  ,"“The press release that C3.ai released around generative AI says they're doing it for enterprise search. [This implies that] they're helping some large company who has a bunch of files or other information search to find the right things within all of their files. ..the enterprise search thing didn't sound that exciting to me. I've worked at a lot of software companies where it's a common like hackathon project for engineers to say, we, we've got all these different systems and we wish we could search them and find the answers to what we're looking for. The trouble in doing that is more often connecting all those systems, security issues, not like our search algorithm isn't good enough.”  "
Spruce Point Question  ,“Do you have any comments on the D.A. Davidson research report?”  
Answer  ,"“The enthusiasm in the report around ChatGPT being a game changer for c3, I disagree with. . . I followed the stock and so I saw the stock jumping in the past week and it made me laugh that ChatGPT is what made the stock jump.”  "
Spruce Point Question  ,“How could Generative AI be integrated into C3's current AI architecture?”  
Answer  ,"“The company has chased trends in the past. I would say that generative AI is AI related. It's just not that related to the other types of AI that C3 has been doing. So, like a typical C3 project is kind of building a business intelligence dashboard where a company can go look at all of their data and gain insights from their data, often with some optimization algorithms applied so they can learn how to do things more efficiently. I just don't, in my mind, see an immediate connection between those types of applications that they've been selling and Generative AI.”  "
