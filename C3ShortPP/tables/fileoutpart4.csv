Microsoft bet on ChatGPT with an investment, not C3.ai  "
Capital Buffer  ,The Company has $800m+ of net cash  ,The CEO has shown a shrewd ability to raise money when interest in the Company is hot. It could dilute investors with an equity raise. Is D.A. Davidson expecting to help raise capital in exchange for putting a Buy rating on the stock?
